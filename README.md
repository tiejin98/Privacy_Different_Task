# Privacy_Different_Task

The full database and text data from our full dataset is coming soon

## Memory Set
In the folder ```Memory Set```, we provide our memory set that be used to inject private information into MLLMs by fine-tuning. ```database_full.xlsx``` contains the database information and ```final_data_full.json``` contains the labels for fine-tuning MLLMs. We also provide two sample codes that using our dataset to do supervised fine-tuning with Idefics2 and Xgen3 on our ```Memory Set```.

## Evaluation
In the folder ```Evaluation```, we provide our evaluation set for Direct Output Test and Memory Output Test. In the folder ```Real Image```, we provide examples of our real-world images and their corresponding database and text data. Again we provide codes that use Xgen3 to generate responses to 5 different tasks with the evaluation set for Direct Output Test and Memory Output Test, respectively.
